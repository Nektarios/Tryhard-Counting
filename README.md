Use `npm i` in order to install all the dependencies.
Simple send **1** in any channel that the bot has permissions to see the messages and make sure it has enough permissions to react as well.

A user cannot send **2** numbers in a row. If you wish to contact me my discord username and tag is `Nektarios#1234` or find out more at my website https://nektarios.wtf
